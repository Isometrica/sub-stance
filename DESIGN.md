# API Design Notes

###Â Idea 1

- A subscription state:
  - Singleton, containing all of the currently active application subscriptions.
  - Configure this provider with subscription specification for different states.
  - It should expose methods that do the following:
    - Transition to a new state - method that, when called, migrates the subscriptions to a new state. Returns promise.
    - Register subscription states.
  - It should expose the following properties:
    - Current state.
    - Current transition promise.
    - Current subscriptions.
  - Wraps `$meteor.subscribe` and `$meteor.autorun` to make its subscriptions.
- Decorator for $stateProvider
  - Looks for `subs` key and auto-configures the route with a dependency for transitioning.
  - The sub services will take care of closing old subs and starting new subs at one point (its transition method), so no need to register multiple setup / teardown handlers.
  - The next state transition will trigger the cleanup of previous subscriptions.
  - States with no subscriptions close everything?
